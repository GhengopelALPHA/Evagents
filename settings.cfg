settings.cfg
This file will be regenerated with defualt values if missing (regeneration is not necissary for the program to work)
Modify any value in this file to change constants in Evagents.
All changes will require a reset or relaunch to take effect

Any lines that the program can't recognize are silently ignored (will work on a fix that tells the user what was/wasnt changed) Please note the sim only takes the last entry of a flag's value if there are duplicates. Also, can you find the hidden config flag?...

Remember to RIGHT-CLICK->RELOAD CONFIG or RELAUNCH the program after modification!!!
